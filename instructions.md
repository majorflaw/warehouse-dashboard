// Page customization instructions

# 1. Main Page (1)
* Make that the main paige when a user loads the website it will give him a dark theme page, with a white text on the middle of the page saying "Welcome, please choose your department..." in a bold font.
* Two buttons under it:
    * "MS"
    * "CVG"
* Those button also should have a dark theme, rounded buttons, but not full rounded, just a little bit rounded.
* When user press on the "MS" or "CVG" button, it should go to another page, where the user has a different text saying "Please choose the flow..."
* Two other buttons under it:
    * "A FLOW"
    * "B FLOW"
* When user press on either of those buttons, it should go to another page, for now those new pages should be empty, we will work on them in the next steps.
* Create also a button for the second page, to go back to the main page.
